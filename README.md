ðŸ‘‹  Hello, world! I am a web developer and designer, writer and art curator. 

âž•  My work leverages creative coding, visual storytelling and information design to build eye-catching websites, data visualizations and apps that bring digital products, user interfaces and artful web experiences to life.  

âž• A multi-lingual (French, English, Dutch, Spanish) creative technologist, I bridge the gap between art, culture, technology and design. Curiosity, creativity, problem-solving and empathy are my core values. My interdisciplinary approach enables me to relate to multiple stakeholders and to translate business objectives into bespoke, user-friendly and visually compelling websites, apps and digital experiences.
