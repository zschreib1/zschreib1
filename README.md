ðŸ‘‹  Hello, world! I am a web developer, designer and writer. 

âž• My work leverages creative coding and latest technology trends to build eye-catching websites and apps that bring digital products, user interfaces and web experiences to life.  

âž• A multi-lingual (French, English, Dutch, Spanish) creative technologist, I bridge the gap between technology, design, art and culture. Curiosity, creativity, and empathy are my core values. I enjoy solving problems whether Iâ€™m desigining user interfaces, building new features, refactoring code or hunting down bugs. My transdisciplinary approach enables me to relate to multiple stakeholders and to translate business objectives into bespoke, user-friendly and visually compelling websites, apps and digital experiences. <br/>Â» https://zoeschreiber.vercel.app
