ðŸ‘‹  Hello, world! I am a web developer, designer and writer. 

âž• My work leverages creative coding and latest technology trends to build eye-catching websites and apps that bring digital products, user interfaces and web experiences to life.  

âž• A multi-lingual (French, English, Dutch, Spanish) creative technologist, I bridge the gap between technology, design, art and culture. Curiosity, creativity, and empathy are my core values. I enjoy solving problems whether Iâ€™m desigining user interfaces, building new features, refactoring code or hunting down bugs. My transdisciplinary approach enables me to relate to multiple stakeholders and to translate business objectives into bespoke, user-friendly and visually compelling websites, apps and digital experiences. <br/>Â» https://zoeschreiber.vercel.app 

âž• I write and curate Zigzags Contemporary Art At Your Finger Tips, a weekly newsletter, blog & Instagram feed highlighting the work of various artists through the prism of current events.

âž• My professional background ranges from pursuing my own entrepreneurial venture as an iOS app founder to working in public facing roles at the nexus of strategic communications and art. I gained a BA in Social Sciences from Sciences Po Paris, including an exchange year at Wellesley College / MIT, an MA in Photography and Video from the Glasgow School of Art and three professional certificates in Computer Science from Harvard University.
